# Conclusions

## How effective tax rates changed between 2017 and 2018

Key conclusions:

* New Yorkers in all adjusted gross income ranges below $1 million paid lower taxes as a percentage of AGI in 2018 than in 2017. (I call this the effective tax rate as shorthand, but see details below.)
* Millionaires in NY, CA, and CT paid higher effective tax rates than in 2017.
* Although non-millionaire New Yorkers received tax cuts, their tax reductions were much smaller than in other states.
* Many other high-tax states had similar changes.


### Scatterplot of changes in effective tax rates between 2017 and 2018, by income range

The figure below illustrates the points above:

* The vertical axis shows the change in effective tax rate between 2017 and 2018. That is, it shows the effective rate in 2018 minus the effective rate in 2017, where the effective rate in each year is the federal tax liability in that year as a percent of adjusted gross income.
* The horizontal axis shows different income ranges. The first group on the left, "All income ranges," shows the average over all tax returns. The next group, "Under $1" shows the results for returns with zero or negative AGI. (Many taxpayers in this range are highly atypical and I wouldn't pay much attention to it.) As you move to the right, we have higher income ranges, ending with millionaires on the far right.
* Each gray point represents a state. I have labeled several states in each income range: NY (blue), US average (red), and selected other states (green). The other states always include CA, CT, FL, MA, NJ, and TX, and in addition I have included the two highest and lowest states in each group.
* The horizontal line is at zero - states above the line had an increase in the average effective tax rate; as you can see, millionaires in CA and CT, as well as in NY, had an increase.
* As you can see, NY is at or near the top for most ranges, meaning that tax reductions were smaller in NY than elsewhere (and millionaires had increases).

Some of the states are difficult to make out. While it is possible to improve the figure, it is probably better to just look at a table. In the details section I've provided tables with data underlying the figure.

#### Map of changes for all taxpayers

The figure below maps the change in effective federal tax rate for all taxpayers. The states with the largest decline are deepest red and those with the smallest decline are deepest blue. As expected, states with lower state and local taxes (e.g., Florida) have the largest federal tax reductions.

The next map shows the change for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes in the $100k to $200k range. Caution: I have used different cutpoints in this map than in the first to keep the number of states in each group reasonably distributed.

### Table of dollar and percent changes in federal income tax liability

Income tax liability of New Yorkers declined in 2018 after rising by double digits in 2017. The table below gives the liability amounts, in $ millions, in 3 tax years, as well as the dollar changes and % changes. It is filterable and sortable, if you want to look at subsets.


```{r tab_taxliab}

tab <- taxliab %>% 
  datatable(colnames = c('2017 minus 2016'='d2017_2016',
                         '2018 minus 2017'='d2018_2017',
                         '% change 2016 to 2017'='pd2017_2016',
                         '% change 2017 to 2018'='pd2018_2017'),

```


### Table of each state's federal income tax liability as a percent of the U.S. total

Federal income tax liability of New Yorkers as a share of income tax liability for the U.S. as a whole increased slightly between 2017 and 2018, from 8.9% to 9.1%. This was true across most income ranges, although not for the $1 million+ range. 

I don't find this measure particularly useful because so many things can affect it and it is hard to disentangle them.

The table below illustrates this. It has the same filtering and sorting capabilities as the table above.


```{r tab_taxliab_share}

tab <- taxliab %>% 
  select(stabbr, agi_stub, aginame, starts_with("TY")) %>%
  group_by(agi_stub) %>%
  mutate(across(.cols=c(TY2016, TY2017, TY2018),
                ~ . / .[stabbr=="US"] * 100,
                .names="{.col}_pct")) %>%
  datatable(filter='top',
            options=list(pageLength = 11),
            caption = htmltools::tags$caption(style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left;',
                                                'Federal income tax liability in $ millions,
                                                and as a percent of the U.S. total,
                                                2016-2018'))
tab %>% formatRound(columns=4:9, digits=1)

### Changes in the number of itemizers

The TCJA increased the standard deduction from $6,500 to $12,000 for individual filers, and from $13,000 to $24,000 for joint returns. Thus, even if there had been no cap on the SALT deduction, far more taxpayers would claim the standard deduction under the new law than under the old law. The increased standard deduction was large enough to more than compensate for the SALT deduction loss for many taxpayers.

The table below shows itemizers as a percentage of total filers in 2017 and in 2018, and the change in this percentage, for the U.S. as a whole and for New York:

*  In 2017 a greater share of New Yorkers itemized than was the case for the U.S. as a whole, in every income range. New York's higher-than-average state and local taxes were probably the main reason for this, although other factors no doubt played a role as well. For example, home prices are higher in New York than in the nation as a whole, the home mortgage interest deduction is somewhat higher for the typical taxpayer in New York.

* In 2018 the percentage of filers who itemized dropped dramatically in every income range in both the U.S. and in New York, with the declines in New York greater than those in the U.S.:
  +  In the U.S., the percentage of filers who itemize fell by 19.5 percentage points.from 31.0% in 2017 to 11.5% in 2018. 
  +  The percentage of NY filers who itemize fell from 22.9 percentage points, from 35.4% in 2017 to 12.4% in 2018.
  
* As a result, unlike in 2017, the percentage of filers who itemized in New York in 2018 was quite similar to the percentage nationally in most income ranges.

### SALT: changes from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018, and size of the SALT cap

The following two tables show information related to salt by income range, for the U.S. as a whole in the first table and for New York in the second.

Each table shows items in the following order:

*  SALT deduction for 2016
*  SALT deduction for 2017
*  Potential SALT deduction for 2018 before the cap
*  Actual SALT deduction for 2018 after the cap
*  Deduction amount lost to the cap in 2018 (2018 uncapped minus 2018 capped)
*  Dollar change from 2017 to 2018
*  Percent change from 2016 to 2017
*  Percent change from 2017 to 2018
*  Deduction lost in 2018 as a percentage of the 2018 uncapped amount

Dollar amounts are in millions of dollars.

It's important to remember that the deduction lost tells only part of the story. The SALT deduction in 2018 is lower than in 2017, not just because of the cap, but also because many more people claim the standard deduction than in 2017, as well as for other reasons such as the incentive to accelerate SALT deductions into 2017, and of course changes in state and local taxes.

#### Changes in SALT for the U.S. as a whole

The SALT cap for people who itemized in 2018 reduced the deduction by $181 billion, or 55.3% of the uncapped amount. However, the overall impact of TCJA on SALT deductions was much greater in that the SALT deduction actually fell by $476 billion between 2017 and 2018, a 76.5% decline. The lost SALT as a percent of the uncapped amount was greatest by far for high income taxpayers.

The SALT deduction increased 10.4% between 2016 and 2017, which is far greater than the increase in state and local taxes in the same time period. (For example, the BEA estimate of state and local taxes in [NIPA Table 3.3]([https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=2#reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&1921=survey) increased by 3.4% between calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2017.) Furthermore, the rate of increase was much greater for high income taxpayers who would be affected by the SALT cap in 2018 than for lower income taxpayers. This suggests, but does not prove, that taxpayers accelerated SALT deductions into 2017.


```{r}
cap("US")
```


#### Changes in SALT for New York

The patter for New York generally is similar to the U.S. However, the increase from 2016 to 2017 of 11.9% was greater than the national 10.4% and the amount lost to the cap at 70.6% was much greater than the national cap loss of 55.3%.

```{r}
cap("NY")
```




## Alternative minimum tax
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly reduced the impact of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) by increasing the AMT exemption, raising the income level at which the exemption begins to phase out, and repealing or reducing important AMT preference items, particularly the SALT deduction. As a result, far fewer people paid the AMT in 2018 and total AMT tax liability was much lower.

```{r include=FALSE}
# N09600	Number of returns with alternative minimum tax 
# A09600	Alternative minimum tax amount

amtvars <- c('N09600', 'A09600')

altvars <- c("a00100", "a06500", "n06500")

vars <- c(altvars, str_to_lower(amtvars))

# tmp <- count(h2n1, varname)

# h2n1 %>% filter(varname=="n04450")
# count(h2n1, stabbr)

amt_base <- h2n1 %>%
  filter(varname %in% vars, measure=="value") %>%
  select(-measure)
count(amt_base, varname, description)

amt <- function(state){
  amt_wide %>%
    filter(stabbr==state) %>%
    kable(digits=c(rep(0, 8), 1, 1), format.args=list(big.mark=","))
}

```


### The number of AMT filers

```{r}

amt_wide <- amt_base %>%
  filter(year>=2016) %>%
  select(-description) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = varname) %>%
  select(year, stabbr, agi_stub, aginame, value=n09600) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year) %>%
  mutate(change_16to17=`2017` - `2016`,
         change_17to18=`2018` - `2017`,
         pch_16to17=change_16to17 / `2016` * 100,
         pch_17to18=change_17to18 / `2017` * 100)

```

 The number of filers in the United States declined 95% in the U.S. as a whole, and 95.9% in New York, as the next two tables show, after increasing significantly in 2017.
 
In the U.S. as a whole, more than 4.8 million fewer people paid the AMT in 2018 than in 2017. More than half a million fewer New Yorkers paid the AMT. 

By far, the largest reductions in numbers of AMT payors were in the $100,000 to $500,000 income ranges.

```{r}

amt("US")
amt("NY")
```

### Total AMT payments
```{r}
# amt_wide <- amt_base %>%
#   filter(year>=2016) %>%
#   select(-description) %>%
#   pivot_wider(names_from = varname) %>%
#   mutate(avgamt=a09600 * 1000 / n09600) %>%
#   select(year, stabbr, agi_stub, aginame, value=avgamt) %>%
#   pivot_wider(names_from = year) %>%
#   mutate(change_16to17=`2017` - `2016`,
#          change_17to18=`2018` - `2017`,
#          pch_16to17=change_16to17 / `2016` * 100,
#          pch_17to18=change_17to18 / `2017` * 100)


amt_wide <- amt_base %>%
  filter(year>=2016) %>%
  select(-description) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = varname) %>%
  mutate(a09600 = a09600 / 1000) %>%
  select(year, stabbr, agi_stub, aginame, value=a09600) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year) %>%
  mutate(change_16to17=`2017` - `2016`,
         change_17to18=`2018` - `2017`,
         pch_16to17=change_16to17 / `2016` * 100,
         pch_17to18=change_17to18 / `2017` * 100)


```

Total AMT liability in the United States fell $32.7 billion (89.6%), with more than half of that reduction occurring in the $200-500 thousand income range.

Total AMT liability in New York fell $4.9 billion (90.7%), which was approximately 15% of the U.S. reduction of $32.7 billion. Again, more than half of the reduction was in the $200-500 thousand income range.

# Descriptive analysis

## Average tax rates

### Change in average tax rates from 2017 to 2018

The figure below shows effective tax rates. Each panel shows total federal income tax as a percentage of adjusted gross income in 2017 and 2018 in each income range the IRS reports. The horizontal axis shows 2017 rates and the vertical axis shows 2018 rates.

In essence this is an effective tax rate, although we have to be a little cautious in treating it as precisely comparable across years because the definition of AGI changed between 2017 and 2018 and I need to investigate the extent to which the denominator changed. We would prefer to have the same definition in each year but we are limited by the data we have.

States above the diagonal line had a higher effective tax rate in 2018 than in 2017, while states below the line had a lower effective tax rate. States are labeled, with New York in blue and the national average in red. We can't identify all states in all panels. If that becomes important to you, I can show each panel separately and larger. I'll add some tables in a later iteration, also, which will allow separate identification of states.

Using language a little loosely, we can see that in all but the $1 million and higher income range, New Yorkers had a tax cut (lower effective tax rate). We can also see that for incomes of $100k and higher, the tax reduction for New Yorkers was less than for most other states and often it is near other New England or northeastern states (i.e., other high-tax states).

We have to be a little cautious about interpretation. Many factors affect the tax rate within an income range, most of which we can't get at with these data:

* Within each income range, New York is to the right - it has a higher effective rate than most other states in the same income range. New Yorkers may be more concentrated in the higher-income portion of each income range and thus subject to higher marginal rates.
* Single filers account for 52% of filers in NY and 48% nationally (including NY), and generally face higher effective rates for a given level of income than do married filers.
* NY has 1.8 exemptions per return versus 1.92 nationally, which would lead to higher taxable income for a given amount of AGI, all else equal.
* On the other hand, NY has higher deductions as a percentage of AGI (15.9%) compared to the nation (12.8%), which would lead to lower taxable income for a given amount of AGI, all else equal.

We would need microdata such as those we will use in the second part of this project (assuming you would like to go forward with it) to get at that issue.

In addition, both years are unusual in some way. The comparison year of 2017 is unusual because there were incentives to push income out of that year and into 2018 when rates were lower, and to accelerate deductions into 2017 when rates were higher, and of course there were incentives to push SALT deductions into 2017. I address this, partially, by putting a similar figure later in this document that compares 2018 to 2016. The general patterns are quite similar so I use 2017 here to reduce risk of confusion. Again, the best way to address this is with microdata.

```

## Number of tax returns

### % change in number of returns: all returns and selected income groups

#### New York, all income ranges
The first table below shows the % change in # of tax returns in NY by income range. We normally would expect returns to grow at somewhere near the rate of population or employment growth -- say 0.5% to 1% on average over the long run. The total number of returns grew 0.5% in 2018, with declines in lower income groups and increases in upper income groups. This general pattern is not surprising although some specific numbers may be.


```{r}
varstate_pch("n1", "NY") %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")

```

One reason the number in lower income groups declines while the number in upper income groups increases is that inflation and productivity growth tends to drive people into higher income brackets over time (unless we adjust brackets so that they are different each year, reflecting inflation). 

A second major factor that affects year-to-year growth is the economy, and particularly capital gains. In stock market boom years people may find their taxable income boosted as a result of capital gains, driving them into higher brackets. This is most relevant to upper-income brackets. The table below, copied from [here](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_total_return_annual) shows total (including dividends) % returns in the S&P 500 on a year-end over year-end basis. Stock market increases tend to be correlated with capital gains, so this likely drove the number of high-income taxpayers up in quite a few of the years in question, including 2016 and 2017. This correlation is not tight and lags and other issues come into play, so I would not over-interpret it. 

![Total return, S&P 500, year-end to year-end](images/sp500.png)

To test this, we look at capital gains income. The table below shows growth in total capital gains income (not average capital gains). It sure looks like the rapid growth in 2017 had a lot to do with the rapid growth in the number of returns in the highest brackets in 2017, and the general movement through the brackets, more than offsetting the impact of the incentive to defer income out of 2017. (Two notes: (1) this is capital gains reported on federal returns so it no doubt differs some from gains reported on NY returns as reported by the Budget Division, and (2) while the growth rates in the lower income brackets are substantial, they don't have much capital gains so it may not have had a big impact on their overall AGI.)


## Capital gains growth in NY
```{r}

varstate_pch("a01000", "NY") %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in net capital gains")

```



A third major factor that affects year to year growth is behavioral shifts in response to actual tax changes and anticipated tax changes. We know there was an incentive to decelerate income out of 2017 into 2018 to take advantage of the lower tax rates enacted for 2018 in the TCJA. It's not obvious from the %-change table above that this happened, but we'll return to this.


#### The United States, all income ranges
The next table shows the same thing for the United States as a whole. The same general pattern of slow growth or decline in the lower income ranges and rapid growth in the upper income ranges holds, for the same reasons.

```{r}
varstate_pch("n1", "US") %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")
# varstate_pch("n1", "CA") %>% kable(digits=1)
# varstate_pch("n1", "CT") %>% kable(digits=1)
# varstate_pch("n1", "FL") %>% kable(digits=1)
# varstate_pch("n1", "TX") %>% kable(digits=1)

```


## % change in number of returns: New York and selected other states, selected income groups
In many of the tables that follow, I compare NY to the US, and to CA, CT, FL, MA, NJ, and TX. I chose these states, because they are large, or neighbors, or often considered comparison states for NY, or some combination of these reasons. FL and TX, of course, have no income tax and FL has a very low overall state-local tax burden.

The first table below shows % change in number of returns overall, just to position our heads. There's quite a bit of variation from year to year and I don't understand all of it. FL and TX have pretty big increases in 2017, which we explore further below.

```{r}
varstub_pch("n1", 0, sts) %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")

```

The next 3 tables show the top 3 income ranges.

```{r}
# varstub_pch("n1", 7, sts) %>% kable(digits=1)
varstub_pch("n1", 8, sts) %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")
varstub_pch("n1", 9, sts) %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")
varstub_pch("n1", 10, sts) %>% kable(digits=1, caption="Percent change in number of returns")
```

Given the extraordinary growth in FL and TX in 2017 in the number of returns in the upper income range, let's look at capital gains in all states in that income range. As you can see, they experienced phenomenal growth in capital gains. These data can't tell us whether the increase in the number of FL millionaire returns was due to out-of-state millionaires moving into FL, or non-millionaire Floridians moving into the FL millionaire bracket due to increased income from realization of capital gains and other factors. The lack of state income taxes in FL and TX makes it relatively more attractive for residents of those states to realize capital gains than it is for residents of high-tax states. On the other hand, IRS migration data (not shown here) show that FL does have a steady annual inflow of high-income taxpayers from other places, and NY has a steady outflow. In my opinion based on reviews of research and other data, the 2017 increase likely was predominantly attributable to people being pushed into higher federal tax brackets although there probably was some of both effects.
